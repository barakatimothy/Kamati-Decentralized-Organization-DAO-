// This is a simple DAO contract that allows members to propose and vote on actions.

// The contract has a membership list, and any member can propose an action by
// calling the propose() function and specifying the action details.

// Other members can then vote on the proposal using the vote() function. If
// the proposal receives more than 50% of the votes, it is considered passed
// and the action is executed.

// The contract also has a fallback function that allows members to pay fees or
// make donations to the DAO.

// Replace "YOUR_CONTRACT_NAME_HERE" and "YOUR_TOKEN_NAME_HERE" with your own names.
